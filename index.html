I'm a Masters student in Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford.
I'm currently learning to code with some help from Entrepreneur First and Oxford IT Services, so I am building this site myself. It's still under construction, so that's why it looks a little rough!
Thanks a lot for looking :-)
